## README
- Demo folder contains our final `code` for modelling
- Demo folder also contains our deliverable `demo` showing how to utilise the code for your own needs
- `scrape_twitter` is our code for scraping Twitter data



## Setup
Please ensure all other files in the folder are in the same directory as `demo`, and the environment is setup with preferably `environments.yml` or `requirements.txt`. Crucially, Theano backend for Keras must be enabled.

1) Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) within your project directory. Setup the environment and activate it in your terminal:

Conda with `environments.yml` (preferred)
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bt4222

```

Pip with `requirements.txt`
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
$ C:\Users\...\project_folder> venv\Scripts\activate
```

2) Clone repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mingboi95/bt4222.git
```
