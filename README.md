**README**
- `code` is our final code for modelling 
- `scrape_twitter` is our code for scraping Twitter data
- Demo folder contains our deliverable, with `demo` showing how to utilise the code for your own needs. Please ensure all other files in the folder are in the same directory as `demo`, and the environment is setup with preferably `environments.yml` or `requirements.txt`. Crucially, Theano backend for Keras must be enabled.
